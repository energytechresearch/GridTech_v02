Great idea — an AI chatbot feature fits the PRD perfectly as a productivity and insight layer on top of the Technology Library, Pilot Management, and Portfolio data.

Here’s what an **AI Chatbot Feature Page** could look like — described as a product/feature spec and UX outline that you can plug into your PRD or designs.

### **4) Interaction Modes**

* **Ask & Retrieve Mode**

  * Returns structured answers + reference links

* **Insight Mode**

  * Trend summaries and analysis text

  * “Help me design a pilot plan”
  * “Draft a lessons-learned note”

---

## **Functional Requirements (Excerpt)**

**FR-1: Natural Language Query**

* User enters a question
* System translates to structured DB query or retrieval pipeline
* AI composes response using contextual rules

**FR-2: Result Transparency**

* Responses include:

  * Linked records
  * Dataset scope
  * Timestamp

**FR-3: Guardrails**

**Left:** Chat thread (conversation history)
**Center:** Active chat window + results
**Right Sidebar:**

* Filters (portfolio / pilot / technology scope)
* Context chips (time range, category, vendor)
* Data sources used in answer

---

## **Success Metrics**

* Reduction in time to find pilot or technology records
* Increased portfolio insights usage
* Fewer ad-hoc reporting requests to analysts
* Higher engagement with Technology Library content

---

## **Future Enhancements (Backlog)**

* “Explain this record” context-aware drill-downs
* Conversational workflow helpers (intake prep, pilot framing)
* Natural-language portfolio report generator
* Integration with email / Teams for exported answers

---

## **If you want, I can also:**

* Turn this into a **visual wireframe description**, or
* Write a **Jira Epic + child stories** for the AI Assistant feature, or
* Help design the **architecture pattern (RAG / vector DB / API gateway)** for connecting the chatbot safely to your database.

Would you like this feature framed more as **internal tooling** or a **stakeholder-facing intelligence assistant**?
