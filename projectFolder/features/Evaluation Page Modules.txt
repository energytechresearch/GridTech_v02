Evaluation Page Modules Specifications
A) Returns Analysis

Inputs: CAPEX, OPEX, incentives, avoided costs, degradation, utilization, tariffs, revenue streams (e.g., capacity payments), discount rate.
Outputs: IRR, NPV, Payback, annual cash‑flow table, sensitivity cases (±% CAPEX/OPEX, adoption rate, performance, tariff changes).
Controls: Add/Edit assumptions; scenario save & compare; export (PDF/Excel).

B) Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) & Downside

Lifecycle cost breakdown (procure, install, integration, maintenance, training, decommission).
Downside scenarios: schedule slip, cost overrun, under‑performance, policy/tariff change.
TCO vs baseline (“do nothing” or incumbent vendor) comparison.

C) Competitive Vendor Comparison — Market Map

Define comparator set and criteria weighting (cost, performance, reliability, interoperability, roadmap, ESG, support/SLA, security).
Vendor scorecards (normalized and weighted).
Visuals: 2×2 (e.g., Value vs Risk), radar charts, table with traffic‑light indicators.

D) Risk Register (Assumption‑Linked)

Risk entries: description, linked assumption(s), likelihood, impact, owner, mitigation, residual risk, trigger, status.
Views: risk heatmap; filter by theme and stage.
Tie risks to decision gates and sensitivity outcomes.

E) Diligence Coordination

Checklist templates: technical, financial, cybersecurity, compliance/interconnection, safety, supply chain.
Assign owners & due dates; upload artifacts; status tracking.
Audit trail of all changes & approvals.

F) Decision Record

Stage gates (Evaluation → Pilot → Deployment → Scale).
Required artifacts to advance; approvers (Finance/PMO/Engineering).
Final go/no‑go + rationale snapshot preserved.

G) Tagging & Taxonomy

Theme tags: DER/Microgrid/Automation/Reliability/Capacity.
Technology types, grid services, standards supported (e.g., IEEE/IEC—metadata only).
